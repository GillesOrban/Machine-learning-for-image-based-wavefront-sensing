# TFE: Phase Retrieval

Light detectors, such as photographic plates or CCDs, measure only the intensity of the light that hits them. This measurement is incomplete because a light wave has not only an amplitude (related to the intensity), but also a phase, which is systematically lost in a measurement. Phase retrieval is the process of algorithmically retrieving the lost phase trough iterative algorithms (Gerchberg-Saxton, ...) or as in this project through machine learning (Convolutional neural network).
